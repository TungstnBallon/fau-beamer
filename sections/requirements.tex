		\item[interoperability] This allows the data to be used by multiple different applications without complex conversion. % FIXME not applications
		\item[columnar] A columnar format has advantages described previously, including faster read times and less memory usage.
		\item[feature toggle] We must be able to (de)activate the new features at runtime.
		\item[compatibility] The \Verb|.sqlite| files produced by the different implementations must be identical.
		\item[modularization] Should it be necessary to write code in a language other than \emph{TypeScript}, this code must be placed in an external library usable from \emph{TypeScript}.
		\item[extensibility] The functionality of the chosen data representation must be extensible.

	\begin{description}[<+(1)->]
		\item[performance] Either a decrease in the execution time for \emph{Jayvee} models, or an extension of the \emph{Jayvee} interpreter's capabilities.
		\item[code style] The source code adheres to the project's code style.
		\item[maturity] We aim to create a prototype, not a mature implementation.
